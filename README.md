## Project Overview
Welcome to my LeetCode Learning Journey project! This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my experiences and progress as I tackle various coding challenges on LeetCode.
## Project Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to establish a structured and effective approach to learning through LeetCode. By organizing my study materials and documenting my thought processes, I aim to enhance my problem-solving skills and improve my coding proficiency. A systematic learning path is crucial for maximizing efficiency, allowing me to build upon foundational concepts as I advance to more complex topics.
## Usage Instructions
This project utilizes Obsidian, a powerful knowledge management tool that allows me to organize my notes and insights effectively. Within this setup, I have incorporated numerous charts created with the Excalidraw plugin, which enhances the visual representation of concepts and solutions.
## Getting Started
To use this project:
Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:
bash
git clone <repository-url>

Open with Obsidian: Navigate to the cloned folder and open it using Obsidian.
Install Excalidraw Plugin: If you encounter issues with images not displaying correctly, please ensure that you have the Excalidraw plugin installed in your Obsidian environment. You can do this by going to the Obsidian settings, selecting "Community plugins," and searching for Excalidraw.
## Explore and Learn
Feel free to explore the various notes, diagrams, and solutions I've compiled throughout my learning journey. I hope this project not only aids my own understanding but also serves as a valuable resource for others looking to enhance their skills on LeetCode. Thank you for visiting my repository!
