## Problem Description

You are given a character array `s`, and you need to reverse the array in place. The function should modify the input array directly and not return anything.

## Example

- **Input**: `s = ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]`
- **Output**: `["o", "l", "l", "e", "h"]`

## Approaches to Solve the Problem

## 1. Two-Pointer Solution

A common approach to reverse the string in place is to use two pointers:

- Initialize one pointer at the beginning (`left`) and another at the end (`right`) of the array.
- Swap the characters at these pointers and then move the pointers towards each other until they meet.

**Time Complexity**: O(n), where nn is the length of the string.  
**Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
            char tmp;
            int left = 0;
            int right = s.length-1;

            while(left < right){
                
                tmp = s[left];
                s[left] = s[right];
                s[right] = tmp;
                left++;
                right--;
            }
    }
}
```

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """

        left,right = 0,len(s)-1
        while(left<right):
            s[left],s[right] = s[right],s[left]
            left+=1
            right-=1   
```

## 2. Recursive Approach with Character Array

graceful but not most efficient method

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """

        def helper(left,right) -> None:
            if(left<right):
                s[left],s[right] = s[right],s[left]
                helper(left+1,right-1)
            
            

        return helper(0,len(s)-1)
```
