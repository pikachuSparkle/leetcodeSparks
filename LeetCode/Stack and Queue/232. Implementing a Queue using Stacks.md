## Problem Description

You need to implement a class `MyQueue` that supports the following operations:

1. **`push(x)`**: Pushes element `x` to the back of the queue.
2. **`pop()`**: Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
3. **`peek()`**: Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
4. **`empty()`**: Returns whether the queue is empty.

## Example

```
queue = MyQueue() 
queue.push(1) 
queue.push(2) 
print(queue.peek()) # returns 1 
print(queue.pop()) # returns 1 
print(queue.empty()) # returns False
```
## Approaches to Solve the Problem

## Using Two Stacks

The main idea is to use two stacks to simulate the behavior of a queue:

- **Stack In**: Used for enqueue operations.
- **Stack Out**: Used for dequeue operations.

When performing a dequeue operation, if Stack Out is empty, transfer all elements from Stack In to Stack Out, which reverses their order, allowing you to pop from Stack Out as if it were a queue.

```python
class MyQueue:

    def __init__(self):
        self.s1 = []
        self.s2 = []


    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        self.s1.append(x)


    def pop(self) -> int:
        if not self.s2:
            while(self.s1):
                self.s2.append(self.s1.pop())

        return self.s2.pop()


    def peek(self) -> int:
        if not self.s2:
            while(self.s1):
                self.s2.append(self.s1.pop())

        return self.s2[-1]


    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return len(self.s1) == 0 and len(self.s2) == 0



# Your MyQueue object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyQueue()
# obj.push(x)
# param_2 = obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.peek()
# param_4 = obj.empty()
```
