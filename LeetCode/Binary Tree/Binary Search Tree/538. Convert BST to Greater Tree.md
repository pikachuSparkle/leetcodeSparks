LeetCode 538, titled **"Convert BST to Greater Tree,"** involves transforming a binary search tree (BST) such that each node's value is replaced by the sum of all values greater than or equal to its own. Here’s a detailed overview of the problem and its solution approach.

## **Problem Overview**

- **Input**: The root of a binary search tree.
- **Output**: The root of the modified binary search tree where each node's value is updated to be the sum of all values greater than or equal to its original value.

## **Key Concepts**

1. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A tree structure where for any given node, all values in the left subtree are less than the node's value, and all values in the right subtree are greater.
2. **Greater Tree Transformation**: This transformation requires a reverse in-order traversal (right-root-left) to accumulate the sum of node values.

## **Solution Approach**

To solve this problem, you can use a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach:

1. **Initialize a Running Sum**: Use a variable to keep track of the cumulative sum as you traverse the tree.
2. **Reverse In-Order Traversal**:
    - Start from the rightmost node (which has the greatest value).
    - Update the current node's value with the running sum.
    - Add the current node's original value to the running sum.
    - Move to the left child and repeat the process.




 NOTES: 
 The reverse of in-order traversal is right-root-left.
 The order of traversal is crucial:
 - left-root-right visits nodes from smallest to largest, 
 - while right-root-left visits nodes from largest to smallest.

```java
 // The reverse of in-order traversal is right-root-left.

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

class Solution {

    private TreeNode pre = null;
    public TreeNode convertBST(TreeNode root) {
        if(root==null) return null;
        

        //in-order traversal 的反向 ---- right-mid-left
        
        //right
        root.right=convertBST(root.right);

        //middle-root
        if(pre!=null) root.val += pre.val;
        pre=root;

        //left
        root.left=convertBST(root.left);

        return root;        
    }
}
```
