LeetCode 236, titled **"Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree"** is a problem that requires finding the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in a binary tree. The LCA is defined as the deepest node that is an ancestor to both nodes.

## **Problem Overview**

- **Input**: The root of a binary tree and two nodes (p and q).
- **Output**: The lowest common ancestor of the two nodes.

## **Solution Approach**

To solve this problem, a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach is commonly used. The algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:

1. **Base Case**: If the current node is null, return null. If the current node matches either p or q, return that node.
2. **Recursive Search**: Recursively search for p and q in the left and right subtrees.
3. **Determine LCA**:
    - If both left and right subtree calls return non-null values, it means p and q are found in different subtrees, so the current node is their LCA.
    - If only one of the subtree calls returns a non-null value, return that value up the recursion stack.

## Approaches:

- There are two situations (scenarios), and the second scenario is automatically included during the processing
```
s1:         s2:
   LCA         p
   / \        /
  p   q      q
```
- backtracking - back-Order traversal

        if(root==p || root == q){return root;}

        //backOrder traversal

        TreeNode left=lowestCommonAncestor(root.left,p,q);

        if(left==null && right == null){return null;}
        else if (left!=null && right == null){return left;}
        else if (left==null && right != null){return right;}
        else {return root;}      
    }
