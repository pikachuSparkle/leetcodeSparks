LeetCode 450, titled **"Delete Node in a BST,"** is a problem that involves deleting a node from a binary search tree (BST) while maintaining the properties of the BST.

## **Problem Overview**

- **Input**: The root of a binary search tree and a value to delete.
- **Output**: The root of the binary search tree after deleting the specified value.

## **Key Properties of a Binary Search Tree**

1. For any node, all values in its left subtree are less than the node's value.
2. All values in its right subtree are greater than the node's value.

## **Solution Approach**

To delete a node from a BST, you need to consider three main cases:

1. **Node to be deleted is a leaf node**: Simply remove it from the tree.
2. **Node to be deleted has one child**: Remove the node and link its parent directly to its child.
3. **Node to be deleted has two children**:
    - Find the node's in-order predecessor (the maximum value in its left subtree) or in-order successor (the minimum value in its right subtree).
    - Replace the value of the node to be deleted with that of the predecessor or successor.
    - Recursively delete the predecessor or successor.


## **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**:
    - Average case: O(logn) for balanced trees.
    - Worst case: O(n) for skewed trees (where all nodes are either left or right children).
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree due to recursion stack space.

## **Conclusion**
This approach efficiently handles deletion in a binary search tree while maintaining its properties. It covers all cases for deletion and ensures that after deletion, the tree remains a valid BST.
## Approaches

- the core idea (logic) of codes
```text
1. Handling termination conditions:
- The corresponding node is not found.
- The node is a leaf node (both left and right are empty).
- The left child is not empty, but the right child is empty.
- The left child is empty, but the right child is not empty.
- If both children are not empty, inherit from the maximum of the left child or the minimum of the right child.

2. Then perform traversal & Catch the return value
```

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

class Solution {
    public TreeNode deleteNode(TreeNode root, int key) {
    
        if(root == null) return null;
        if(root.val == key){

            if(root.left==null & root.right==null){return null;}
            else if(root.left!=null & root.right==null){return root.left;}
            else if(root.left==null & root.right!=null){return root.right;}
            else{
                TreeNode cur=root.right;
                while(cur.left!=null){cur=cur.left;}
                cur.left = root.left;
                return root.right;
            }
        }
        //begine traversal and find key
        if(root.val<key){root.right=deleteNode(root.right,key);}
        if(root.val>key){root.left=deleteNode(root.left,key);}

        return root;
    }
}
```
