LeetCode 701, titled **"Insert into a Binary Search Tree"** is a problem that requires you to insert a new value into an existing binary search tree (BST). The goal is to maintain the properties of the BST after the insertion.

## **Problem Overview**

- **Input**: The root of a binary search tree and a value to insert.
- **Output**: The root of the binary search tree after inserting the new value.

## **Key Properties of a Binary Search Tree**

1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node’s value.
2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node’s value.
3. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

## **Solution Approach**

To insert a new value into the BST, you can follow these steps:

1. **Start at the Root**: Begin at the root of the tree.
2. **Compare Values**:
    - If the new value is less than the current node's value, move to the left child.
    - If it is greater, move to the right child.
3. **Find the Insertion Point**: Continue this process until you find an empty spot (where a child is `None`).
4. **Insert the New Node**: Create a new node with the given value and attach it to the appropriate parent node.

## **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. In a balanced BST, this would be O(logn), but in a skewed tree, it could be O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(h) for the recursion stack in case of a recursive solution.

## **Conclusion**

This approach efficiently inserts a new value into a binary search tree while maintaining its properties. It is important to handle edge cases, such as inserting into an empty tree or ensuring that duplicate values are managed according to specific requirements (if applicable).

## Approaches

`The core idea is that a binary search tree can always find a leaf node to insert the new node.`

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

class Solution {
    public TreeNode insertIntoBST(TreeNode root, int val) {

        if(root==null){
            TreeNode node = new TreeNode(val);
            return node;
        }

        //find left 
        if(val<root.val){
            root.left=insertIntoBST(root.left,val);
        }

        //find right
        if(val>root.val){
            root.right=insertIntoBST(root.right,val);
        }

        return root;        
    }
}
```
