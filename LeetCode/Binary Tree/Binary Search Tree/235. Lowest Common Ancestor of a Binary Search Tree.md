LeetCode 235, titled **"Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree,"** is a problem that requires finding the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in a binary search tree (BST). The LCA is defined as the deepest node that has both nodes as descendants.

## **Problem Overview**

- **Input**: The root of a binary search tree and two nodes p and q.
- **Output**: The lowest common ancestor of the two nodes.

## **Solution Approach**

To solve this problem efficiently, you can utilize the properties of binary search trees. The basic idea is to traverse the tree starting from the root and make decisions based on the values of p and q relative to the current node:

1. **If both p and q are less than the current node's value**, then both nodes must be in the left subtree. Move to the left child.
2. **If both p and q are greater than the current node's value**, then both nodes must be in the right subtree. Move to the right child.
3. **If one of p or q is equal to the current node's value**, or if one is on one side (left or right) and the other is on the opposite side, then the current node is their LCA.

## **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. In a balanced BST, this would be O(log⁡n), but in a skewed tree, it could be O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of space for pointers.

## Approaches

- problem solving order 236-235
- Essentially, it utilizes the properties of the BST to search from top to bottom.
- Why is it that when we are in the middle, it is definitely the lowest common ancestor?
- Iterative method?


```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }

 */

class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {

        if(root == null) return null;

        
        //left
        if(root.val>p.val && root.val >q.val){
            TreeNode left=lowestCommonAncestor(root.left,p,q);
            if(left != null) return left;
        }
        //right
        if(root.val<p.val && root.val <q.val){
            TreeNode right=lowestCommonAncestor(root.right,p,q);
            if(right != null) return right;
        }

        //本题 middle-root 的位置无所谓
        return root;
        
    }
}
