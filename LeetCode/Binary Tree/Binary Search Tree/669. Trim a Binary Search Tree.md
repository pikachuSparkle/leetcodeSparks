LeetCode 669, titled **"Trim a Binary Search Tree,"** is a problem that requires you to trim a binary search tree (BST) so that all its elements lie within a given range. The goal is to remove nodes that fall outside the specified range while maintaining the properties of the BST.

## **Problem Overview**

- **Input**: The root of a binary search tree and two integers, `low` and `high`, representing the range.
- **Output**: The root of the trimmed binary search tree.

## **Key Properties of a Binary Search Tree**

1. For any node, all values in its left subtree are less than the node's value.
2. All values in its right subtree are greater than the node's value.

## **Solution Approach**

To trim the BST, you can use a recursive approach:

1. **Base Case**: If the current node is `None`, return `None`.
2. **Trim Left Subtree**: If the current node's value is less than `low`, it means all nodes in its left subtree are also out of range. Thus, return the result of trimming the right subtree.
3. **Trim Right Subtree**: If the current node's value is greater than `high`, it means all nodes in its right subtree are also out of range. Thus, return the result of trimming the left subtree.
4. **Recursively Trim Both Subtrees**: If the current node's value is within range, recursively trim both left and right subtrees and return the current node.

## **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, you may have to visit every node.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h) for the recursion stack space, where h is the height of the tree.

## **Conclusion**

This approach efficiently trims a binary search tree while maintaining its properties. By leveraging recursion and understanding how BSTs are structured, you can effectively remove nodes that fall outside a specified range.


## Approaches

- It feels simpler than deleting a single node in problem 450. 
- When encountering a position that can be trimmed, you cannot return immediately; you need to continue traversing further because there may also be nodes that are out of range later on

        if(root.val<low){

        }

        if(root.val>high){
            TreeNode left = trimBST( root.left,  low,  high);
            return left;
        }

        root.left=trimBST( root.left,  low,  high);
        root.right=trimBST( root.right,  low,  high);

        return root;
        
    }
}
