LeetCode 108, titled **"Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree,"** involves converting a sorted array into a height-balanced binary search tree (BST). Here’s a concise overview based on the provided search results:

## **Problem Overview**
- **Input**: A sorted integer array `nums`.
- **Output**: A height-balanced binary search tree.

## **Definition of Height-Balanced BST**

A height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

## **Approach to Solution**

To solve this problem, you can use a recursive approach:

1. **Base Case**: If the left index exceeds the right index, return `None`.
2. **Find the Middle Element**: Calculate the middle index to ensure minimal height:
    mid=(left + right)/2
3. **Create a Tree Node**: Use the middle element as the root node.
4. **Recursively Build Subtrees**:
    - Call the function recursively for the left half of the array to create the left subtree.
    - Call the function recursively for the right half of the array to create the right subtree.

## **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`, because we visit each element once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(logn) due to recursion stack space in a balanced tree.

## **Conclusion**

This problem effectively utilizes recursion and properties of binary search trees to create a balanced structure from a sorted array. The approach ensures that each subtree remains balanced by always selecting the middle element as the root during each recursive call.


## Approaches:

- Think of constructing a binary tree using post-order or pre-order traversal. 
- First, find the middle node, then find the left subtree and right subtree.

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

class Solution {
    public TreeNode sortedArrayToBST(int[] nums) {

        TreeNode root = traversal(nums,0,nums.length-1);
        return root;
        
    }

    private TreeNode traversal(int[] nums,int left,int right){

        if(left>right) return null;

        int mid = (left+right)/2;
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);

        root.left=traversal(nums,left,mid-1);
        root.right=traversal(nums,mid+1,right);
        return root;

    }
}
```
