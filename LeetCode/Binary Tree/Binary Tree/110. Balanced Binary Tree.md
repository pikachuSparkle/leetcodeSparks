## Problem Description

You are tasked with implementing a function that checks if a binary tree is balanced. If the tree is empty, it is considered balanced.

## Input

The input consists of a binary tree represented by its root node.

## Output

The output should be a boolean value: `true` if the tree is height-balanced, and `false` otherwise.

## Example

Consider the following binary tree:

```
          1 
         / \ 
        2   3 
       / \ 
      4   5
```

This tree is balanced because the depths of the left and right subtrees of every node differ by at most 1.
In contrast, the following tree:

```
           1 
          /
         2 
        / 
       3 
      / 
     4
```

is not balanced because the left subtree has a depth of 4 while the right subtree has a depth of 0, resulting in a difference greater than 1.

## Solution Approaches

1. **Recursive Depth Calculation**:
    
    - Use a helper function to calculate the height of each subtree.
    - For each node, check if the heights of its left and right subtrees differ by more than 1.
    - If they do, return false; otherwise, continue checking recursively.
    
2. **Optimized Approach**:
    
    - Combine height calculation and balance checking in a single traversal.
    - Return both the height and whether the subtree is balanced to avoid redundant calculations.

    public boolean isBalanced(TreeNode root) {

        return getHeight(root)==-1 ? false : true; 
        
    }

    public int getHeight(TreeNode root){
        if(root ==null){return 0;}
        
        //left
        int leftHeight=getHeight(root.left);
        if (leftHeight==-1) {return -1;}
        //right
        int rightHeight=getHeight(root.right);
        if (rightHeight==-1) {return -1;}
        //root-middle
        if(Math.abs(leftHeight-rightHeight)>1){return -1;}
        else {return 1+Math.max(leftHeight,rightHeight);}

    }
}
