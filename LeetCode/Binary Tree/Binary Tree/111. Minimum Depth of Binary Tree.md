`min height = min depth`

## Problem Description

Given a binary tree, your task is to determine its minimum depth. If the tree is empty (i.e., the root is `null`), the minimum depth should be reported as **0**.

## Input

The input consists of a binary tree represented by its root node.

## Output

The output should be a single integer representing the minimum depth of the tree.

## Example

For example, consider the following binary tree:

```
       1 
      / \ 
     2   3 
      \ 
       4
```

In this case, the minimum depth is **2**, corresponding to the path from node **1** to node **3**.

## Solution Approaches

There are two common approaches to solve this problem:

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
    
    - Traverse the tree recursively.
    - For each node, check if it is a leaf node.
    - If it has only one child (either left or right), continue traversing down that child.
    - Keep track of the minimum depth found during traversal.
    
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
    
    - Use a queue to explore each level of the tree.
    - As soon as you encounter a leaf node, return its depth because BFS guarantees that this will be the shortest path.
    

Both methods have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int minDepth(TreeNode root) {

        return getHeight(root);
        
    }



    private int getHeight(TreeNode root){
        if (root==null) return 0;

        //left
        int leftHeight=getHeight(root.left);
        //right 
        int rightHeight=getHeight(root.right); 
        //root-middle 
        if(root.left==null && root.right!=null){return 1+rightHeight;}
        if(root.left!=null && root.right==null){return 1+leftHeight;}
        int height=1+Math.min(leftHeight,rightHeight); 
        return height;

    }

}
```
