## Problem Description

Given the root of a binary tree, you need to return the value of the leftmost node in the last row. For example, consider the following binary tree:

```
        1 
       / \ 
      2   3 
     / \ 
    4   5
```

In this tree, the leftmost value in the last row isÂ **4**.

## Solution Approaches

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

A straightforward approach to solve this problem is using a Breadth-First Search (BFS). This method involves traversing the tree level by level while keeping track of the nodes:

1. Initialize a queue and add the root node.
2. While the queue is not empty:
    
    - Record the first node's value at each level.
    - Process all nodes at that level by adding their children to the queue.
    
3. The last recorded value will be the leftmost value in the last row.

BFS easy to understand
```

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def findBottomLeftValue(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:

        result = []
        queue = []

        if root is not None:
            queue.append(root)
        
        while len(queue)>0:
            row = []
            size = len(queue)

            while size > 0 :
                curNode = queue.pop(0)
                row.append(curNode.val)
                if curNode.left is not None:
                    queue.append(curNode.left)
                if curNode.right is not None:
                    queue.append(curNode.right)
                size -= 1

            result.append(row)
        
        return result[-1][0]

```





## Depth-First Search (DFS)

Alternatively, you can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach. This method involves traversing down to the deepest level while keeping track of whether you are visiting a left child:

1. Create a helper function that takes the current node and its depth.
2. If you reach a new depth, update the leftmost value.
3. Recursively call the function for left and right children.
