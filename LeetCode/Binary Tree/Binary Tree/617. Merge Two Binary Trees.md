## Problem Statement

You are given two binary trees, `root1` and `root2`. The goal is to create a new binary tree where:

- If both nodes exist at the same position, their values are summed.
- If only one of the nodes exists, that node is used as is.
- If neither node exists, that position remains null.

## Example

For instance, given two trees:

```
Tree 1:       1              Tree 2:         2              
             / \                            / \            
            3   2                          1   3           
           /                                   \          
          5                                     4
```

The merged tree would look like:

```
Merged Tree:   3                
              / \              
             4   5             
            / \            
           5   4
```

## Solution Approach

The solution can be implemented using a recursive approach. The base cases include:

- If both nodes are null, return null.
- If one node is null, return the other node.
- If both nodes are present, create a new node with the sum of their values and recursively merge their left and right children.

    public TreeNode mergeTrees(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {

        if(root1 == null){return root2;}
        if(root2 == null){return root1;}

        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(0);
        
        //root-middle
        root.val = root1.val + root2.val;
        //left
        root.left=mergeTrees(root1.left,root2.left);
        //right
        root.right=mergeTrees(root1.right,root2.right);

        return root;

    }
