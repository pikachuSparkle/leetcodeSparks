`max height = max depth`
## Problem Description

You are given an N-ary tree, which is a tree structure where each node can have multiple children. The task is to find the maximum depth of this tree.

## Input

The input is typically represented as a serialized format of the N-ary tree, where each group of child nodes is separated by null values.

## Output

The output should be a single integer representing the maximum depth.

## Example

For instance, consider the following N-ary tree:

```
              1 
            / | \ 
            3 2 4 
           / \ 
           5 6
```

In this example, the maximum depth is **3**, represented by the path from node **1** to either **5** or **6**.

## Solution Approaches

There are two common approaches to solve this problem:

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
    
    - Traverse down each branch of the tree recursively.
    - Keep track of the depth as you go deeper into the tree.
    - Update the maximum depth found during traversal.
    
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
    
    - Use a queue to explore each level of the tree.
    - Count the levels until all nodes at a given level have been processed.
    

Both methods are effective, but DFS is often simpler to implement for this type of problem due to its recursive nature.
