## Problem Description

The task is to determine the total number of nodes in a complete binary tree efficiently, ideally in less than O(n)O(n) time complexity, where nn is the total number of nodes.

## Input

The input consists of a binary tree represented by its root node.

## Output

The output should be a single integer representing the total count of nodes in the tree.

## Example

For example, consider the following complete binary tree:

```
	       1 
          / \ 
         2   3 
        / \ / 
       4  5 6
```
In this case, the total number of nodes is **6**.

## Solution Approaches

There are two main approaches to solve this problem:

1. **Naive Approach**:
    
    - Perform a simple traversal (like DFS or BFS) to count all nodes.
    - This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(h), where hh is the height of the tree.
    
2. **Optimized Approach Using Properties of Complete Binary Trees**:
    
    - Calculate the depth of the leftmost and rightmost paths.
    - If both depths are equal, it indicates that the left subtree is a perfect binary tree, and you can compute its size using the formula 2depth−12depth−1.
    - Recursively count nodes in the right subtree.
    - If depths differ, it indicates that the right subtree is a perfect binary tree, and you can use similar logic to count nodes recursively in the left subtree.

    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if(root==null){return 0;}
        
        int leftNum = countNodes(root.left);
        int rightNum = countNodes(root.right);
        int allNum = 1+leftNum+rightNum;
        return allNum;
