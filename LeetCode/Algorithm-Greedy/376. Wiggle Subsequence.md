## Problem Definition

A sequence is defined as a wiggle sequence if:

- The differences between consecutive numbers alternate in sign.
- The first difference can be either positive or negative.
- A sequence with fewer than two elements is also considered a wiggle sequence.

## Examples

1. **Input:** `[1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]`  
    **Output:** `6`  
    **Explanation:** The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.
2. **Input:** `[1, 17, 5, 10, 13, 15, 10, 5, 16, 8]`  
    **Output:** `7`  
    **Explanation:** One possible wiggle subsequence is `[1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8]`.
3. **Input:** `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`  
    **Output:** `2`  
    **Explanation:** The only wiggle subsequences are formed by picking any two elements.

## Solution Approach

To solve this problem efficiently:

- Use a greedy approach or dynamic programming.
- Maintain two variables to track the lengths of the longest wiggle subsequences ending with an upward or downward movement.

## Greedy Algorithm Implementation

```java
class Solution:
    def wiggleMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        if len(nums) == 1:
            return 1

        prediff = 0
        curdiff = 0
        result =  1

        # when there is s horision line (prediff=0)
        # when there is a limit position, left limit and right limit (two index, prediff default = 0)
        # when there is a up-horision-up line  (when find a wiggle, refresh the prediff)
        for i in range(0,len(nums)-1): 
            curdiff = nums[i+1] - nums[i]
            if (prediff>=0 and curdiff<0) or  (prediff<=0 and curdiff>0) :
                result += 1
                prediff = curdiff # the postion is important, only change when there is a wiggle

            
        return result
