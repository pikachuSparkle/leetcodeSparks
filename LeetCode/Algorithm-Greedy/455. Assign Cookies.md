## Problem Description

You are given two arrays:

- `g` (the greed factor of each child)
- `s` (the size of each cookie)

The task is to determine how many children can be made happy by assigning them cookies. A child is happy if their greed factor is less than or equal to the size of the cookie assigned to them.

## Example

For the input:
`g = [1, 2, 3] s = [1, 1]`

The expected output is `1`, meaning only one child can be made happy because there are not enough cookies to satisfy all children's greed factors.

## Solution Approach

## Greedy Algorithm

The optimal approach involves sorting both arrays and using a two-pointer technique:

1. Sort the greed factor array `g` and the cookie size array `s`.
2. Initialize two pointers: one for the children (`i`) and one for the cookies (`j`).
3. Iterate through both arrays:
    
    - If the size of the cookie at index `j` is greater than or equal to the greed factor of the child at index `i`, increment both pointers (indicating that this child has been made happy).
    - If not, increment only the cookie pointer `j` to find a larger cookie.
    
4. Continue until all cookies are considered or all children are evaluated.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this approach is O(nlog⁡n+mlog⁡m)O(nlogn+mlogm) due to sorting both arrays, where n is the number of children and m is the number of cookies.

```java
class Solution:
    def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:

        g.sort()
        s.sort()

        gratify_children = 0
        child_i = len(g)-1
        cookie_j = len(s)-1

        while     child_i >= 0   and    cookie_j >= 0 :        
            if g[child_i] <= s[cookie_j]: # If the cookie can satisfy the child 
                gratify_children += 1     # Increment satisfied children count
                child_i -= 1    # Move to the next child
                cookie_j -= 1  # Always move to the next cookie
            else :
                child_i -= 1
                
        return gratify_children
```
