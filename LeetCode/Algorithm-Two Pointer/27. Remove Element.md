LeetCode 27, titled **"Remove Element,"** is a problem that requires you to remove all instances of a specified value from an array in place. Here’s a detailed overview of the problem and its solution approach.

## **Problem Overview**

- **Input**: An integer array `nums` and an integer `val`.
- **Output**: The new length of the array after removing all occurrences of `val`. The elements beyond this new length do not matter.

## **Key Constraints**

- You must modify the input array in place without allocating extra space for another array.
- The order of elements can be changed.

## **Example**

- **Input**: `nums = [3, 2, 2, 3]`, `val = 3`
- **Output**: `2`, with the first two elements being `[2, 2]`.

## **Solution Approach**

To solve this problem, you can use a two-pointer technique:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**:
    
    - Use one pointer (`left`) to track the position to place the next non-`val` element.
    - Use another pointer (`right`) to iterate through the array.
    
2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
    
    - If the current element at `right` is not equal to `val`, assign it to the position at `left`, and increment both pointers.
    - If it is equal to `val`, just increment the `right` pointer.
    
3. **Return the Length**:
    
    - After iterating through the array, return the value of `left`, which represents the count of non-`val` elements.

## **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where nn is the length of the array since we are iterating through it once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) because we are modifying the array in place without using additional data structures.

## **Conclusion**

This approach effectively removes all instances of a specified value from an array while maintaining an efficient time and space complexity. By utilizing a two-pointer technique, you can achieve the desired result without unnecessary overhead.

There's a place for everything and everything in its place.

- slow Index (pointer) means 坑 (hole)


```python
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:

        slowIndex = 0
        fastIndex = 0

        for fastIndex in range(0,len(nums)):
            if(nums[fastIndex] != val):
                nums[slowIndex] = nums[fastIndex]
                slowIndex += 1
        
        return slowIndex
        
```
