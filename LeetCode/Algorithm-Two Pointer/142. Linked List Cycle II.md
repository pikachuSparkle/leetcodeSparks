LeetCode 142, titled **"Linked List Cycle II,"** is a problem that involves detecting the starting node of a cycle in a linked list. Here's a concise summary of the problem, its requirements, and the solution approach.

## Problem Description
You are given a linked list that may contain a cycle. The task is to return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`. The solution should not modify the linked list, and it should ideally use constant space.

## Key Points
- **Input**: The head of a linked list.
- **Output**: The node where the cycle begins or `null` if there is no cycle.
- **Constraints**: Do not modify the linked list structure.

## Solution Approach

1. **Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm (Two Pointer)**:
    - Use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time, while the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time.
    - If there is a cycle, the `fast` pointer will eventually meet the `slow` pointer within the cycle.
    
2. **Finding the Start of the Cycle**:
    - Once a meeting point is found (i.e., both pointers meet), initialize another pointer at the head of the linked list.
    - Move this new pointer and the `slow` pointer one step at a time. The point at which they meet again will be the start of the cycle.
3. **Mathematical Insight**:
    - When `slow` and `fast` meet inside the cycle, it can be shown mathematically that moving from the head of the list and from the meeting point will lead to the start of the cycle.

NOTES:
1. The fast pointer moves at a speed that is 2 steps per iteration, while the slow pointer moves at a speed of 1 step per iteration. Therefore, it will not miss the meeting point.
- Fast moves 2 steps.
- Slow moves 1 step.
2.  **Mathematical Proof**:  
```
slow=x+y 
(where x is the distance from the head to the start of the cycle, and y is the distance from the start of the cycle to the meeting point).

fast=x+y+n(y+z)
(where nn is the number of complete cycles made by the fast pointer, and zz is the distance from the meeting point back to the start of the cycle).

2×slow=fast

```

```
From the above, we derive:  

x=(n−1)(y+z)+z
(When `slow` and `fast` meet inside the cycle, it can be shown mathematically that moving from the head of the list and from the meeting point will lead to the start of the cycle.)

Mathematical reasoning is crucial; 
it’s helpful to understanding with diagram.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        if head is None:
            return None

        fast = head
        slow = head

        while (slow.next is not None and fast.next is not None and fast.next.next is not None):
            
            # check the cycle is right
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
            if(slow == fast):
                index1=head
                index2=slow
                while(index1!=index2):
                    index1=index1.next
                    index2=index2.next
                return index1
        
        return None
```


## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where nn is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since only a fixed number of pointers are used.

This approach efficiently determines whether a cycle exists and identifies its starting node without using additional data structures, adhering to optimal space constraints.
