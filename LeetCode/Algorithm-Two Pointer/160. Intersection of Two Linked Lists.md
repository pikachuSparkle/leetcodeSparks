The problem is to find the node at which two singly linked lists intersect. If they do not intersect, the function should return `null`. This problem is commonly encountered in coding interviews and tests understanding of linked lists.

## Problem Description

You are given two linked lists, represented by their respective head nodes `headA` and `headB`. The task is to determine the node where these two lists intersect. The intersection node is defined as the first common node in both linked lists.

**Example Cases**:
1. **Example 1**:
    - **Input**:
        - `intersectVal = 8`
        - `listA = [4,1,8,4,5]`
        - `listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5]`
        - `skipA = 2` (two nodes before intersection)
        - `skipB = 3` (three nodes before intersection)
    - **Output**: Reference of the node with value `8`.
2. **Example 2**:
    - **Input**:
        - `intersectVal = 2`
        - `listA = [0,9,1,2,4]`
        - `listB = [3,2,4]`
        - `skipA = 3`
        - `skipB = 1`
    - **Output**: Reference of the node with value `2`.
3. **Example 3**:
    - **Input**:
        - `intersectVal = 0`
        - `listA = [2,6,4]`
        - `listB = [1,5]`
        - `skipA = 3`
        - `skipB = 2`
    - **Output**: `null` (the two lists do not intersect).
## Solution Approaches

This problem is not difficult at all; it's just that the problem description is a bit hard to understand.
The key to this problem is how to find two lists of equal length, and then perform traversal with two pointers simultaneously. 
There are two approaches:
- One approach is to connect the two linked lists A and B, resulting in a combined linked list of length m+n.
- Another approach is to find the shorter one of the two linked lists A and B, and then traverse from the position of the head of the shorter list." 

#### Approach 1

The optimal solution involves using a two-pointer technique:
1. Initialize two pointers, `a` and `b`, at the heads of the two linked lists (`headA` and `headB`).
2. Traverse both linked lists simultaneously:
    - If pointer `a` reaches the end of its list, redirect it to the head of the other list (`headB`).
    - Similarly for pointer `b`.
3. Continue this process until either both pointers meet at the intersection node or both become null (indicating no intersection).
This approach ensures that both pointers traverse an equal distance by effectively "equalizing" their lengths through redirection.

#### Approach 2

NOTES: This code implement another approach as follows:

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        # get length of ListA
        lenA = 0
        cur = headA
        while cur:
            cur=cur.next
            lenA += 1

        # get length of ListB
        lenB = 0
        cur = headB
        while cur:
            cur=cur.next
            lenB += 1

        # keep ListB is the longer List
        if lenA>lenB:
            lenA,lenB = lenB,lenA
            headA,headB = headB,headA

        curA = headA # shorter List
        curB = headB # longer List
        # move curB to the right position
        for _ in range(lenB-lenA):
            curB = curB.next

        while curA != curB:
            curA = curA.next
            curB = curB.next

        return curA
        
```

```
**Code Logic Explanation:**
1. **Calculate Lengths of Both Lists**
2. **Ensure ListB is the Longer List**
3. **Align Both Pointers**
4. **Traverse Both Lists Simultaneously**
5. **Return Result**
```

In summary, this method efficiently finds the intersection node by leveraging the lengths of both linked lists and aligning them for simultaneous traversal. This approach ensures that we only traverse each list once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two lists, while maintaining a space complexity of O(1) since no additional data structures are used.
