LeetCode Problem 19, titled **Remove Nth Node From End of List**, involves manipulating a singly linked list. The objective is to remove the nth node from the end of the list and return the head of the modified list.


## Problem Description

You are given the head of a linked list and an integer n. Your task is to remove the n-th node from the end of the list and return the head of the list after the removal.

## Example Cases

1. **Input**: `head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n = 2`  
    **Output**: `[1, 2, 3, 5]`
2. **Input**: `head = [1], n = 1`  
    **Output**: `[]` (the list is empty after removal)
3. **Input**: `head = [1, 2], n = 1`  
    **Output**: `[1]`

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is sz.
- 1≤sz≤30
- 0≤Node.val≤100
- 1≤n≤sz

## Approach to Solution

## Two-Pointer Technique

A common approach to solve this problem is using a two-pointer technique:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**: Start both pointers at the head of the list.
2. **Advance One Pointer**: Move one pointer nn steps ahead.
3. **Move Both Pointers**: Move both pointers simultaneously until the first pointer reaches the end of the list.
4. **Remove Node**: At this point, the second pointer will be just before the node that needs to be removed. Adjust its `next` pointer to skip over the target node.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(L), where LL is the length of the linked list.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since no additional data structures are used.

In this code:

- A dummy node is used to simplify edge cases (like removing the head).
- Two pointers traverse the list as described.
- The node to be removed is effectively skipped by adjusting pointers.

This solution efficiently handles all specified constraints and edge cases associated with linked lists.

- First, move forward n steps. 
- Considering that we need to know the node before the n-th node from the end, we need to move n + 1 steps.


```python

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        dummyNode = ListNode(0)
        dummyNode.next = head

        fast = dummyNode
        slow = dummyNode

        # Move fast pointer n + 1 steps ahead
        for _ in range(n + 1):
            fast = fast.next
        
        while fast:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next

        slow.next=slow.next.next

        return dummyNode.next
```
