## Problem Description

Given an integer array `temperatures`, the task is to return an array `answer` such that:

- `answer[i]` is the number of days until a warmer temperature.
- If there is no future day with a warmer temperature, `answer[i]` should be 0.

## Example

For the input:
`temperatures = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]`

The expected output is:
`[1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]`

This means:
- On day 0 (73°F), the next warmer day is day 1 (74°F) — wait 1 day.
- On day 1 (74°F), the next warmer day is day 2 (75°F) — wait 1 day.
- On day 2 (75°F), wait until day 6 (76°F) — wait 4 days.
- And so forth.

## Solution Approaches

## **Brute Force Method**

The simplest approach is to use a nested loop to check each day's temperature against all subsequent days. This results in a time complexity of O(n2)O(n2), which can be inefficient for large inputs.


## **Optimized Approach Using Monotonic Stack**

A more efficient method involves using a **monotonic stack**. This approach maintains a stack that keeps track of indices of the temperatures in decreasing order. Here’s how it works:

1. Initialize an empty stack and an output array filled with zeros.
2. Iterate through each day's temperature:
    
    - While the stack is not empty and the current temperature is greater than the temperature at the index stored at the top of the stack:
        
        - Pop the index from the stack and calculate the difference between the current index and this popped index. This difference gives the number of days waited for a warmer temperature.
        
    - Push the current index onto the stack.
    
3. Continue until all temperatures are processed.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n)O(n) since each index is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.

单调栈-方向是单调递增(MonotonicStack ---- the direction is non-decreasing)
```
if t[i]>st.pop() result[st.pop()]=i-st.pop()
if t[i]=st.pop() push
if t[i]<st.pop() push
```
pay attention to diff st.pop() & st.peek() in codes
Time complexity is O(n)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] temperatures) {

        Stack<Integer> indexStack = new Stack<Integer>();
        int[] result = new int[temperatures.length];

        indexStack.push(0);
        for(int i =1;i<temperatures.length;i++){
            while(!indexStack.isEmpty() && temperatures[i]>temperatures[indexStack.peek()]){
                int topIndex = indexStack.pop() ;
                result[topIndex]=i-topIndex;             
            }
            indexStack.push(i);
            
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
