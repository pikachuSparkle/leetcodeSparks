## **Problem Statement:**  
You are given an array of integers representing the weights of stones. Each time you select two stones and smash them together, the lighter stone is destroyed, and the heavier stone's weight is reduced by the weight of the lighter stone. If both stones have the same weight, both are destroyed. The goal is to determine the smallest possible weight of the remaining stone after all possible operations.**Example:**

- Input: `stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]`
- Output: `1`
- Explanation:    
    - Smash stones 7 and 8: remaining stones = [2, 4, 1, 1, 6]
    - Smash stones 6 and 4: remaining stones = [2, 1, 2]
    - Smash stones 2 and 2: remaining stones = [1]

## Approach to Solve the Problem

https://www.cnblogs.com/masbay/p/14378775.html
对于无论对于2D `dp[i][j]` 和 1D `dp[j]` 数组定义，均有两种定义:
1. `i` means the stones from index `0` to index `i`, index `[0,i]`
```
dp[i][j]=max(dp[i-1][j],dp[i-1][j-weight[i]]+value[i])
a bit difficult to init
```
2. `i` means the stones number is `i`, index `[0,i-1]`
```
dp[i][j]=max(dp[i-1][j],dp[i-1][j-weight[i-1]]+value[i-1])
easy to init
```

以1D 的dp数组为例，0-1背包的核心代码：
```
for (int i = 0; i < weight.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = bagWeight; j >= weight[i]; j--) {
        dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j-weight[i]] + value[i]);
    }
}
```
以上这段代码中，i的范围是从0到weight.size-1的闭区间，理解为物品0到物品weight.size()-1。
还可以写成：
```
for (int i = 1; i <= weight.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = bagWeight; j >= weight[i-1]; j--) {
        dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j-weight[i-1]] + value[i-1]);
    }
}
```

i的范围为1到weight.size()闭区间，理解为前1件物品和前weight.size()件物品。
## DP - The Knapsack Problem


## Approach 1 - JAVA 2D DP, index range `[0,i]`

define `dp[i][j]` means the max weight of coordinator `[i][j]`
`i` means pick any of `[0,i]` elements
`j` means the limit of snapsack

Formular:
`dp[i][j]=max(dp[i-1][j],dp[i-1][j-stones[i]]+stones[i])
init the `dp[][]` as follows:

|     | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 2   | 2   | 2   | 2   | 2   | 2   | 2   | 2   | 2   | 2   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 2   | 2   | 2   | 2   | 2   | 7   | 7   | 9   | 9   | 9   |
| 2   | 0   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| 3   | 0   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| 4   | 0   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| 5   | 0   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

```java
class Solution {
    public int lastStoneWeightII(int[] stones) {
        
        int sum = 0;
        for (int stone : stones) {
            sum += stone;
        }
        int target = sum/2;

        int[][] dp = new int[stones.length][target+1];

        // init boundry
        for(int i=0;i<stones.length;i++){dp[i][0]=0;}
        for(int j=0;j<target+1;j++){
            if(j-stones[0]<0){dp[0][j]=0;}
            else{dp[0][j]=stones[0];}   
        }
        // calculate dp[][]
        for(int i=1;i<stones.length;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<target+1;j++){

                if(j-stones[i]<0){
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j];
                }else{
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j],dp[i-1][j-stones[i]]+stones[i]);
                }
            }
        }
        return sum-2*dp[stones.length-1][target];
    }
}
```

## Approach 2 - Python 2D DP, `[0,i-1]`

1. Based on basic 01 Knapsack Problem
2. Pay attention to `dp[i][j]` defination, especially the i range, means select the number of stone is i, index range `[0,i-1]`, it's easy to init `dp[i][j]`
3. **Help to understand the 1D DP approach**

```python
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:

        arraySum = sum(stones)
        length = len(stones)
        target = arraySum//2

        dp = [[0]*(target+1) for _ in range(length+1)]
        dp[0][0] = 0

        for i in range(1, length + 1):
            for j in range(target + 1):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
                if j >= stones[i - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j] , dp[i - 1][j - stones[i - 1]]+stones[i - 1])

        return arraySum - 2 * dp[length][target]
```


## Approach 3 - Graceful Python 2D DP Approach By AI


```
Sure thing! LeetCode 1049, known as the "Last Stone Weight II," can be solved using dynamic programming. Here's how you can approach it with a 2D DP table:

Problem Recap: Given an array of stone weights, the goal is to find the minimum possible weight difference between two groups of stones.

2D DP Approach: We'll use a 2D DP array dp[i][j] where i is the number of stones considered and j is the possible weight we can achieve with these stones.

Here's a Python solution to get you started:
```

```python
def lastStoneWeightII(stones):
    total = sum(stones)
    n = len(stones)
    target = total // 2
    
    dp = [[False] * (target + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = True
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(target + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            if j >= stones[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] or dp[i - 1][j - stones[i - 1]]
    
    for j in range(target, -1, -1):
        if dp[n][j]:
            return total - 2 * j

# Example usage:
stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
print(lastStoneWeightII(stones))  # Output: 1
```

```
In this code, dp[i][j] means whether you can get weight j using the first i stones. At the end, you just need to find the largest j where dp[n][j] is True, which will give you the closest weight sum to half the total sum of stones. The answer will be the difference between the total weight and twice this closest weight.
```


## Approach 4 - 1D DP Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:

        arraySum = sum(stones)
        length = len(stones)
        target = arraySum//2

        dp = [0]*(target+1)
        dp[0] = 0

        for i in range(1, length + 1):
            for j in range(target,stones[i - 1]-1,-1):
                dp[j] = max(dp[j] , dp[j - stones[i - 1]]+stones[i - 1])

        return arraySum - 2 * dp[target]

```
