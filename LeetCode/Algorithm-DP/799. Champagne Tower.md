## Problem Description
When champagne is poured into the top glass, it can overflow into the glasses directly below it. Each glass can hold a maximum of 1 unit of champagne (or 250 ml). If a glass overflows, the excess champagne is equally distributed to the two glasses directly beneath it.

## Input Parameters
- **poured**: The total amount of champagne poured into the top glass (an integer).
- **query_row**: The row number of the glass you want to query (0-indexed).
- **query_glass**: The position of the glass in that row (0-indexed).

## Output
The output should be the amount of champagne in the specified glass after pouring, capped at 1.0 (indicating full).
## Example
For instance:
- If `poured = 1`, `query_row = 1`, and `query_glass = 1`, the output would be `0.0` because no champagne overflows to that level.
- If `poured = 2`, `query_row = 1`, and `query_glass = 1`, the output would be `0.5` since the champagne splits evenly between two glasses in the second row.

## Solution Approach

A common method to solve this problem is using **dynamic programming**. You can create a 2D array where each entry represents the amount of champagne in each glass. The algorithm iteratively fills this array based on how much champagne overflows from each glass.

NOTES: Simulate the water flowing process

```python
class Solution:
    def champagneTower(self, poured: int, query_row: int, query_glass: int) -> float:

        prev_row = [poured]

        for i in range(1,query_row+1):

            curr_row = [0]*(i+1)
            for j in range(0,i):
                extra = prev_row[j]-1
                if extra > 0 :
                    curr_row[j] += 0.5*extra
                    curr_row[j+1] += 0.5*extra
            prev_row = curr_row

        return min(1,prev_row[query_glass])
